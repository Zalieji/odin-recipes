# odin-recipes

This project is a simple recipe website

The purpose of this project is to test my knowledge of HTML. 

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. It will also include pictures. 

By the end of this project I hope to have increased my command of attributes. I will demonstrate proper syntax for elements and become more competent with git.

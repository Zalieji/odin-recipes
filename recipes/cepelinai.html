            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>8 large Idaho potatoes, peeled and finely grated, about 5 pounds</li>
            <li>2 large Idaho or Russet potatoes, about 1 1/2 pounds, peeled, boiled, and riced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely grated</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 pound bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons milk, as needed</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>    

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together ground meat, finely chopped onion, the salt, a few grinds of pepper, and the egg until well combined.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice to the raw grated potatoes so they don't turn brown.</li>
            <li>Place them in a fine-mesh cheesecloth or cotton dishtowel, and twist over a large bowl to get rid of the excess water.</li>
            <li>Pour off the water, reserving the potato starch at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the cheesecloth and place the raw potatoes in the bowl with the potato starch you reserved from the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked riced potatoes, grated onion, and the salt, more to taste. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Put a large stockpot of well-salted water on to boil.</li>
            <li>To form the zeppelins, take about 1 cup of dumpling mixture and pat it flat in the palm of the hand.</li>
            <li>Place 1/4 cup or more of meat mixture in the center and, using slightly dampened hands, fold the potato mixture around the meat into a football shape, sealing well. Continue until both mixtures are used.</li>
            <li>Carefully lower dumplings (in batches if necessary to prevent crowding) into salted, boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of cornstarch has been added (to prevent dumplings from falling apart).</li>
            <li>Make sure water returns to the boil; reduce the heat to low and continue simmering until the filling is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon or strainer, drain briefly on a clean dish towel and place on a heated platter.</li>
            <li>While the dumplings are boiling, make the gravy. In a medium skillet, fry the bacon and chopped onion until tender.</li>
            <li>Drain and combine with sour cream and black pepper. Thin with 1 to 2 tablespoons milk if necessary.</li>
            <li>Ladle the gravy over the dumplings or pass the gravy at the table.</li>
        </ol>
